                                                Digital Stop Watch With Dual Mode

This project implements a Digital Stopwatch with Dual Mode (Increment and Countdown) Using ATmega32 and Seven-Segment 
Display.

  Project Overview:
 
This project involves creating a versatile stopwatch that operates in two distinct modes:
1. Increment Mode (Default): The stopwatch counts upwards from zero, displaying hours, 
minutes, and seconds on six seven-segment displays.
2. Countdown Mode: The stopwatch counts downwards from a user-defined time, 
functioning as a countdown timer.

Controls:

-Reset: Resets the stopwatch to its initial state.

-Pause/Resume: Pauses and resumes time tracking.

-User Time Adjustment: Easily set hours, minutes, and seconds.

Visual Feedback:

-LED Indicators: Display status changes.

-Buzzer: Alarm sound when countdown reaches zero.






Hardware Used:

-ATmega32 Microcontroller

-Six multiplexed seven-segment displays

-Push buttons for control

-Buzzer and LED indicators
